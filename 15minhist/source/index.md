The 15 Minute Histogram Challenge
=================================

## Welcome to the 15-Minute Histogram Challenge!

The 15-Minute Histogram Challenge is a hands-on tutorial that guides you step by step to set up ServiceX and create a histogram using a dataset you already work with in your research. It’s practical, focused, and designed so you can go from setup to results in just **15 minutes** or less.

## Why Take the Challenge?

We call it a *challenge* because we challenged ourselves to make this tutorial—and the ServiceX startup process—as fast and streamlined as possible. In under 15 minutes, you’ll be able to:

- Explore ServiceX and its capabilities  
- Gain confidence using it in your research workflow  
- See real, tangible results with your own data  

It’s a quick, rewarding way to jumpstart your ServiceX experience.

## What You’ll Need

To get the most out of this challenge, make sure you have:

1. **ATLAS Software Tutorials knowledge** – If you haven’t completed them yet, start with the [software tutorial](https://atlassoftwaredocs.web.cern.ch/analysis-software/AnalysisSWTutorial/) first.  
2. **Python and a virtual environment** – Installed and ready to go.  
3. **A dataset for analysis** – Ideally one stored in **Rucio** or **EOS**. If you don’t have one, we’ll provide a sample dataset, but using your own data will make the experience even more valuable.

## Let’s Get Started!

You’re ready to dive in! Head to the next page to install and initialize ServiceX in your environment and start building your histogram.
